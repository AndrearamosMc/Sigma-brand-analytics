# Brand Analytics, KPIs & Risk Assessment – Sigma Case Study

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of **brand performance, consumer behavior, and operational risks** for a large food industry company. Using KPI design, risk assessment frameworks, and a Power BI dashboard, the project connects **data insights with marketing, operational, and strategic decision-making**.

The work was developed as a team-based academic project using **Sigma Alimentos** as the business case.

---

## Business Context
Sigma operates in a highly competitive consumer goods market where brand perception, availability, and operational reliability directly impact sales and profitability.

The challenge was to:
- Understand how consumers move through the **brand funnel**
- Identify **key performance indicators (KPIs)** tied to growth and profitability
- Assess **operational, strategic, and data-related risks**
- Translate insights into **actionable recommendations**

---

## Objective
The main goals of this project were to:

- Design a structured **KPI catalog** aligned with business objectives  
- Analyze brand performance across the full consumer funnel  
- Evaluate risks using a **Probability × Impact Matrix**  
- Build a **Power BI dashboard** to support decision-making  
- Propose mitigation strategies and strategic actions  

---

## KPIs & Analytics Approach

### KPI Framework
A KPI catalog was created to ensure consistency, clarity, and ownership. Key KPIs included:

- Brand Awareness  
- Consideration Rate (Lower Funnel)  
- Trial Rate  
- Purchase Rate  
- Repeat Purchase Rate  
- Brand Love  
- Funnel Conversion Rate  
- Brand Attribute Performance  
- Demographic and regional breakdowns  

Each KPI includes a clear definition, formula, data source, reporting frequency, target, and responsible area.

---

## Dashboard Overview (Power BI)
The Power BI dashboard provides a unified view of brand and consumer performance, including:

- Customer conversion funnel (awareness → recommendation)  
- Brand perception radar (emotional and functional attributes)  
- Purchase and repurchase rates  
- Channel distribution and consumer landscape  
- Temporal purchase patterns across brands  

The dashboard was designed to be intuitive for **marketing and business users**, not only technical teams.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Framework
Risks were analyzed using a **Probability × Impact Matrix**, covering:

- Operational risks (e.g., logistics, cold chain failures)  
- Strategic risks (e.g., market share loss, competition)  
- Financial risks (e.g., cost fluctuations)  
- Data and analytical risks (e.g., incorrect KPIs or poor data quality)  

### Mitigation Strategies
For each high-impact risk, mitigation actions and indicators were defined, including:

- Leading indicators (early warnings)
- Lagging indicators (business impact)
- Responsible areas (Logistics, Marketing, Finance, BI)

---

## Key Insights
- Strong brands show high awareness, trial, and repurchase rates, reinforcing long-term growth.
- Weak funnel transitions reveal opportunities to improve conversion between awareness and consideration.
- Operational risks such as cold chain failures can quickly translate into reputational and financial losses.
- Poor data quality or misaligned KPIs represent a critical analytical risk for decision-making.

---

## Business Recommendations
- Centralize brand and risk KPIs into a single executive dashboard  
- Strengthen data validation and governance for KPI tracking  
- Use funnel insights to improve marketing efficiency by segment and channel  
- Promote a proactive risk culture supported by data and alerts
